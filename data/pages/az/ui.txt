====== AZ User Interface Library ======

User Interface of AZ is a set of javascript-libraries consists of:
  * [[az:ui:scripts.js|Core library]]
  * Editing library
  * Query Editor
  * Chart library

===== Editing library =====

Editing library is a set of JavaScript functions and objects, which are placed in **editing20.js** file. It contains code, which:
  * transforms special control placeholders to controls with appropriate type
  * handles control events, like change of value, clicks, typing, and checks them for compliance with control restrictions, like max, min etc.
  * triggers sending changed control values to server, and handles related server errors.

===== Query editor =====

===== Chart library =====
Chart library embeds to existing html by writing a code below:
<code html>
<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="d3c.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="d3c.css">
</code>
It uses [[az:ui:scripts.js|Core UI library]] and [[http://d3js.org|D3]]. It defines **D3C** object in **window**, and you should call **D3C.setup()** to replace all specially marked html elements on page to chart objects.

Usually **D3C.setup()** called on load event.

If you want, you can use **editing20.js** with its **prepareControls** calling **D3C.setup()** if it exists in window.
<code html>
<script type="text/javascript" src="editing20.js"></script>
</code>
==== Chart element syntax ====
Any element with **d3c** attribute defined will be used to generate chart element. By default, it leaves source of chart visible. Other parameters are defined by element attributes, which are:
  * **d3c-hide** - hide chart's source
  * **d3c-width** - width of chart element in pixels
  * **d3c-height** - height of chart element in pixels
  * **d3c-row** - css selector of table rows within container, marked with **d3c** attribute.
  * **d3c-cell** - css selector of table cells within row, defined by **d3c-row**
  * **d3c-head** - css selector of captions of table columns within container, marked with **d3c** attribute.
