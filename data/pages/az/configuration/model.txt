====== Project model description ======
===== model.ini =====
This file contains descriptions and UI instructions to:
  * Tables
  * Queries
  * Table fields
  * Relations between tables
The syntax of //model.ini// is near to SQL.

You can define strings as '//**string**//' or with //(=S: **string** :S=)// construction if you want to use commas in that string. 

Syntax of documentation description:
  [unnecessary variant] = this variant could be unused  
  {variant1|variant2|variant3} = you must use one of the variants
  {1-9} = {1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9}
  

==== Table ====
<code javascript>
TABLE table_name ['caption[@@special_caption']] ( 
  field_definitions
)
</code>
=== Simple fields ===
<code javascript>
  field_name {CHAR|VARCHAR|DECIMAL|BLOB|CLOB}[(size[,precision])] ['caption[@@special_caption]'] 
  [PK] 
  [CHOOSE] 
  [SEARCH{1-9}{=|*=|^=}'regular_expression'] 
  [ORDER({1|-1})] 
  [REQUIRED] 
  [HIDDEN] 
  [UI_LINE] 
  [VALUES:name] 
  [RE] 
  [MIN] 
  [MAX] 
  [UI_SIZE] 
  [='expression']
</code>
=== Relation ===
<code javascript>
  relation_name @table_name ['caption[@@special_caption]'] [UI_LINE]
</code>
=== Field properties ===
== PK ==
You must define //PK// for your table for correct relations to it. Table may have multiple //PK//s
== CHOOSE ==
//Choose-variant// of [[az:engine:tabler|tabler]] will consists of fields marked with //CHOOSE// keyword. Otherwise it will contain all its fields.
== SEARCH ==
  SEARCH{1-9}{=|*=|^=}'regular_expression'
== Expression ==
  ='sql_expression'
In //sql_expression// you must use **$a** as a placeholder of table alias. You can only use fields of current table. Controls generated for those fields are for read only.

=== Table identification ===
Visible value of accomplished choice from table is expression of //table identification//. By default, it's equal to PK
  ID:'sql_expression'
In //sql_expression// you must use **$a** as a placeholder of table alias. You can only use fields of current table.
<code>
ID:'$a.f1 || $a.f2'
ID:(=S: COALESCE( $a.enf_fw || ' ', '') || COALESCE(SUBSTRING( $a.enf_iw,1,1)||'. ','') || COALESCE(SUBSTRING( $a.enf_ow,1,1) || '.','') :S=)
</code> 
=== Page of fields ===
  PAGE:'unique_caption'
=== Group of fields ===
  UI_GROUP[:CLOSED]:'unique_caption'
