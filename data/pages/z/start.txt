===== Z UI Library design keynotes =====
While constructing new JavaScript Z core, you have to take into consideration some keystone aspects of UI workflow.
==== Working within form ====
How controls will work within <form> tag. What will happen on form submit. Does controls have proper **name** attribute, or it will be handled by script.


==== Find Control ====
How you can find control itself, its dependent elements. Control is a wide area collection of DOM elements belong to different parent nodes. They can be neighbors, or not.
==== Value ====
Control has a **server value** and **visual value**. It's common they are the same, but sometimes they differ.
==== Control states ====
Generally, control has states, which are:
  * Read only
  * Error
  * Editable
  * Printable
  * Sample

There are conversions between them.
Each control is wide area collection of dom elements, so conversion of control states leads to understanding the way of control finding.
==== Events ====
There are many events which occurs in control workflow. 
  * Save
  * Choose

They all must be easily described and handled.

==== Modularization ====
Control behavior, its transformation of states etc., must be described with single module

==== Sample conception ====
Control has a 'sample' state, and has ability to understand some 'condition' to become real instance of sample.
Sample state : Sample is always invisible, sample is a source for clone

==== Mutual dependence of controls ====
Control's value and visibility depend on other controls. So, it intercepts onload event of page for first load and onchange event for value change.
